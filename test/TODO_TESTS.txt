TESTS

1. Empty data
2. Non-numeric data
3. Mixed delimiters
4. Text delimited files
5. Beyond maximum and minimum data required
6. Invalid data (out of the world or ellipsoid)
7. Data from other programs (Google Earth, ArcGIS, QGIS, Excel)
8. Coordinates from:
   A) Northern hemisphere
   B) Southern hemisphere
   C) Equator
   D) Both Northern and Southern Hemispheres
   E) Maybe more than this but I forgot..

Why x-axis coordinates change when converting from UTM to LonLat and check/uncheck the Southern Hemisphere box?

Maybe this should not happen!
